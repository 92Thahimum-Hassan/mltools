% The FMVU model is an implementation of maximum variance unfolding
% that avoids the semi-definite program by parameterizing the
% covariance matrix through the latent variables. The distance
% constraints are then implemented by Lagrange multipliers. This leads
% to an interesting model where the gradients are given through a
% Laplacian matrix formed by the Lagrange multipliers. This makes the
% connections to models like LLE and LE much clearer.
